Jawbone UP Node Demo
========

A demo of the absolute basics you need to connect up a Node server to the Jawbone UP API and return user data.

If you make something super fantastic from this basic code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com.

Yay technology!
